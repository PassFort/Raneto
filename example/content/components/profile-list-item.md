The profile page displays your applicants and customers in list form. Each list item is referred to as the "Profile list item."

</div>

The profile list item shows the name of the applicant or customer and can be clicked to take you to the full profile view. The entity type (individual, company etc) is stated below. Next to the entity type are any associated tags.

To the right are the profile options comprising buttons and dropdown menus that allow quick and direct access to, and control of, specific parts of the profile.

</div>

To the right of the profile options will be a status label if needed. At a top level this shows any hold ups or actions that need to be taken to move the profile toward a decision.

When a status label is present the action link to the right of that will also be present. Clicking this will take you directly to the part of the profile that requires attention.

If the profile list contains the company entity type then you may also see a downward pointing chevron to the very far right of the profile list item. If this is present you can click the icon to reveal the status of any checks that are being completed on associated entities.
