There are two ways to add or remove tags from a profile. 

From the main profile list page each profile list item has tagging functionality located underneath the entity name. Within a profile the tagging functionality is located to the right of the entity name.

<div class="img-container">
![alt text](%image_url%/content/tags.png "Screenshot of tags function")
</div>

New tags can be added by clicking on the "+" button. Tags can be removed by clicking on the "x" adjacent to the tag.
