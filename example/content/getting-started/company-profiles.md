Company profiles show you all stages of your compliance process along with all data collected, the results of any checks, validation results for any submitted documents and the status of any ongoing monitoring.

The title area of the profile shows the name of the company's file you are viewing. It allows you to perform tasks that are relevant to the entire profile such as adding and removing tags, tracking the profile, viewing and downloading the audit report, deleting and making a decision. 

The stage menu on the left of the screen shows you all the stages that are present in your process and the result of each. Any stage that displays an indicator other than a tick/check require action from a compliance officer, select this stage to see the specific actions that you need to be taken. 

The main window in the centre of the screen is where you can find the process information that relates to the stage that has been selected. This is where you will be able to perform additional tasks, request more information, approve submitted documents etc.
