Title: Profile list 
Sort: 2
*/

The profile list page gives an overview of your entire profile base, pre and post decision. Each specific profile also displays it's own status, indicating the action that needs to be taken to move the profile toward a decision. The default view is to show applicants in chronological order, allowing you minimise the onboarding delay for your potential customers.

</div>

You can switch between applicants and customers by using the tabs at the top of the screen. You can further filter these categories by changing the selected option in the dropdown menu next to the page title. Items you have selected for tracking will also be available to you by clicking on the Tracked tab.

You can also adjust the amount of profiles you want to view per screen and browse profiles using the pagination function at the top right of the screen.
