Title: Individual identity check
Sort: 2
*/

An individual identity check is performed to establish if the identity of an applicant or customer exists. This is determined by checking for name and address matches of the applicant or customer against official databases of information such as the electoral roll, credit databases, identity registers and landline lists.

Ordinarily an identity check is considered to have passed if the minimum standard of two name matches and two address matches are returned, but this could be higher or lower depending on your specific process.
