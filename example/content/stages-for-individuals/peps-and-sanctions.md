Title: Peps & sanctions screening
Sort: 4
*/

This stage allows you to investigate and match any potential politically exposed individuals or individuals that are either historically or presently subject to sanctions. The PEPs & sanctions screening stage is carried out every day at midnight so all results are less than 24 hours old.

The table at the top contains definite and likely possible matches that need to be investigated. Below are other possible matches that have been marked as inaccurate, these will also continue to be screened daily.

The name, nationality, date of birth, area of interest and general status of each potential match is displayed in table form. To the right of each table row, a button is present that opens a modal window allowing you to view the screening data and investigate the results in more detail. 

With the modal window open, the first tab in view will show you details of any political exposure, including the role, dates and tier level.
